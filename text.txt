the client.py is the code to integrate openai into the jarvis project
it is paid element and therefore need to buy the subscription for it to work.

also in the main.py there is gttx i.e. google text to speech module which is also a paid element
hence it has been commented out so that the program doesnt get interrupted.

NOTE: if you are using gttx, then remember to name it as friday as it has a female voice.

P.S. there seem to be a problem with news section in this project and i dont know why and i am too lazy to figure it out so i am writing
this text to remind my future self to look into it.
